## Summary

Remove runtime coupling to background pages from popup/options/confirm flows.

## Checklist

- [ ] Replace direct background-page access with message/port RPC.
- [ ] Migrate direct-call hotspots to async-safe command paths.
- [ ] Add retry/reconnect handling for service-worker wake/suspend cycles.

## Definition of Done

- No required UI flow depends on `getBackgroundPage`.
