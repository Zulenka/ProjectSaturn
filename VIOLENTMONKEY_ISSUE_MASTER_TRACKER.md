Note: This is a metadata-first triage fill (titles + labels from `issues.json`).
Validate `Repro` and `Disposition` against comments/reproduction before closing issues.

## Priority 1 (Pinned)

1. #1934 - [Feature] Manifest V3 for Chrome
   - Priority: P0
   - Category: policy / browser-compat / architecture
   - Why first: Chromium support strategy and MV3 direction affects disposition and scope for multiple other issues.
   - Link: https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey/issues/1934

## Triage Instructions

- Use `ISSUE_TRIAGE_TEMPLATE.md` for classification and response templates.
- Keep `#1934` as the first architectural/program decision before broad Chromium issue work.
- Update `Priority`, `Area`, `Browser`, `Repro`, `Disposition`, and `Owner` fields as triage progresses.
